I developed this game as a didactic experience to gain some experience with Godot engine, in fact, this is my first project with Godot and i choose to make a pong game because I think that Pong is the easiest game to develop for beginners. In this game (for now) you will find only two modes: "1 player" and "2 players". In "1 player" mode you can use the W and S keys to move you platform (that is the blue one in the left) while, in "2 players" mode, the first player must use the W & S keys and the second one can use the arrow keys UP and DOWN.

## Gameplay
The gameplay is similar to the original pong with small differences: in fact, the ball will increase its speed at every bounce of the players (not the walls) to force them to miss it. You must also remember the angular bounce of ball: if the ball crash at the center of the player, it will bounce horizontaly but, if it crash in a position different to the center, its trajectory will become more angled.

## Neon style
I chosed a neon style because of my inspiration to the synthwave and to develop my abilities with the environment nodes of Godot. I'm very excited about the neon style of my game and i added a wall wallpaper to show clearly the effects of the lights.

## Contribute
If you want to contribute to this project, remember that it was developed with Godot 3, and if you want to use Godot 4, the conversion could cause errors, and you will be forced to manually fix everything.
